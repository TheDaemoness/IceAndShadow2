Ice and Shadow II - Doomed Cities
A brutal new realm for the avaricious and masochistic.

This is a rewrite of the original Ice and Shadow to rework its content, and make it easier to maintain for future updates.

Ice and Shadow II is further licensed under the GPL v3, unlike the originally closed source Ice and Shadow I.

Ice and Shadow II will skip support for Minecraft 1.8. It will be ported to Minecraft 1.9 once it's released and once Forge stabilizes.
