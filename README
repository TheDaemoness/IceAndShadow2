Ice and Shadow II - Doomed Cities
A brutal new realm for the avaricious and masochistic.

This is a rewrite of the original Ice and Shadow to rework its content, and make it easier to maintain for future updates.

Ice and Shadow II is further licensed under the GPL v3, unlike the originally closed source Ice and Shadow I, at least for the portions of the code to which the GPL v3 may be applied.

Due to the absolutely infuriating state of Minecraft's development, support for versions after 1.7 is unlikely.
