# Ice and Shadow II
_A brutal new realm for the avaricious and masochistic._

The mod implements a dimension that serves as post-endgame content for base Minecraft.
It's intended to be challenging but still entirely playable for players who know to be careful.

This is a rewrite of the original Ice and Shadow mod to rework its content.
Ice and Shadow II is licensed under the GPL v3 wherever the GPL may be applied.

## Dependencies
* Minecraft 1.7.10. Other versions of Minecraft are unsupported and, as this is mostly a stress relief project, are unlikely to ever be supported.
* Not Enough Items (or some equivalent), while not required, is strongly recommended.

## Getting Started
* Find the best armor you can get your hands on, and wear it.
    * Full diamond armor is strongly recommended.
    * You may wish to take multiple sets of boots.
    * Be advised that your armor is likely to break very quickly from damage.
* Get yourself a reasonably strong set of weapons and tools and take them.
    * Taking a well-enchanted bow with a good supply of arrows is strongly recommended.
* Combine a nether star, an ender pearl, and a snowball in a crafting space (shapeless).
* Travel to a dark location that is cold enough for snow to fall. You'll know you're in the right place when you can teleport.
* Hold the teleport crystal and use it (hold down your use item button, which is probably the right mouse button) until you teleport.
* Refer to the wiki for more information.
